# 10. A school decided to replace the desks in three classrooms. Each desk sits two students.
# Given the number of students in each class, print the smallest possible number of desks
# that can be purchased.
# The program should read three integers: the number of students in each of the three
# classes, a, b and c respectively.
# Hint. In the first test there are three groups. The first group has 20 students and thus needs 10
# desks. The second group has 21 students, so they can get by with no fewer than 11 desks.
